# Mastering Price Action Trading

Price action trading is the discipline of making trading decisions based on the actual price movement on a chart, rather than relying on indicators.

## Why Price Action?

Indicators are lagging by nature. Price action is real-time. By understanding how price moves, you can identify high-probability entries and exits before the indicators even react.

### Key Concepts
1. **Support and Resistance**: Identifying levels where price has historically reversed.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Understanding if the market is making higher highs or lower lows.
3. **Candlestick Patterns**: Reading the psychology behind each candle.

Price action trading requires patience and discipline, but it is one of the most powerful tools in a trader's arsenal.

# Introduction to Trading Psychology

Trading is 10% strategy and 90% psychology. Many traders have profitable systems but fail because they cannot manage their emotions.

## The Pillars of Trading Psychology

### 1. Discipline
Sticking to your plan even when you are on a losing streak.

### 2. Risk Management
Never risking more than you can afford to lose. This reduces the emotional impact of a loss.

### 3. Emotional Control
Avoiding the trap of "revenge trading" after a loss or becoming overconfident after a win.

Mastering your mind is the first step to becoming a consistently profitable trader.

# Essential Risk Management Strategies

The primary goal of a trader is not to make money, but to stay in the game. Without proper risk management, even the best strategy will eventually blow your account.

## Key Strategies

* **The 1% Rule**: Never risk more than 1% of your total account balance on a single trade.
* **Risk-to-Reward Ratio**: Aim for a minimum of 1:2. This means you make $2 for every $1 you risk.
* **Stop Losses**: Always use a stop loss to define your maximum loss before entering a trade.

By implementing these strategies, you ensure that no single loss can significantly damage your capital.
